### To start with the new git repository we need to use:
-  ``git init`` to create the the git repostiory

### Then we need to make sure everything is in main branch!

-  ``git branch -m main``

### Now we need to add the remote for the connection.

-  ``git remote add origin <link>``

### After the remote we need to pull the content if we added ReadMe in the creating tab of this repostiory

-  ``git pull <remote> <branch>``

## Commiting first changes.
- ``git add *`` for adding all changes made in the project
- ``git commit -m "<comment about the changes you made>``"
- ``git push --set-upstream origin main``

## Follow this steps to make new repository!
If you have any problems try googling! See you later!
